================

A demo show how to use express.js with mvc.

You can get a new project start with this instand of express-generator.

Usage
-----

1. $ git checkout https://github.com/jinchizhong/express-mvc-demo.git
2. $ npm install
3. $ bin/www

You can use follow command to get a clean template:

    $ rm -rf .git LICENSE README.md

Do not remove .gitignore, I think it's valuable to you.

Enjoy yourself.

Details
-------

### models

All models is storaged to ./models. Database configures is storaged to config/environments.js.
Framework will read environment variant `EXPRESS_ENV` to decide which configure is used.
If `EXPRESS_ENV` is not set, development configure will be used.

By default, sqlite3 is used and all db storage to ./db/xxx.sqlite3. 
It's really a bad idea to stroage data to sqlite, in production environment.
So, you had better to change it, before deploy to production environment.

sequelize.js is used for ORM. You can get more documents here: http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/

### routes

You can edit routes.js to configure your own route list.
The file format is so clear. So, I think I don't need tell more.
'main#add\_comment' mains controller 'main' action 'add_comment'.
add\_comment in controllers/main.js will be called.

### controllers

All controllers is stroage to ./controllers.
Each file is a controller. Each function in file is an action.

### views

Same as file generated by express-generator.
Nothing changed.
